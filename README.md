# Andrew's Project Portfolio

Hi! My name is Andrew, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Applied Statistics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Below are my favorite data science projects I've completed, whether for class or out of personal interest. They are listed in order of recency. 

## [Project 1: Topic Modeling on TED Talks](https://github.com/ngandr/TED_Talks_NLP)

I cleaned and preprocessed over 4,000 English-language TED Talk transcripts and performed some exploratory data analysis on the data. I then fitted and tuned a non-negative matrix factorization model, which extracted 20 clear topics from the transcripts, achieving the highest coherence score of .319. 

## [Project 2: Cluster Analysis on Anime Data](https://github.com/ngandr/anime_proj)
